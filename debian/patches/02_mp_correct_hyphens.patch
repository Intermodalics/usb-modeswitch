 These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, 
 with long options starting with two dashes ('--').  A summary of 
 options is included below. 
-.IP "\fB-h\fP \fB\-\-help\fP         " 10 
+.IP "\fB\-h\fP \fB\-\-help\fP         " 10

+.IP "\fB\-v\fP \fB\-\-default-vendor NUM\fP         " 10 
 Vendor ID to look for (mandatory), usually given as hex number (example: 0x12d1).
 Each USB device is identified by a number
 officialy assigned to the vendor by the USB association and a number for the
 respective model (product ID) chosen by the vendor
-.IP "\fB-p\fP  \fB\-\-default-product NUM\fP         " 10 
+.IP "\fB\-p\fP  \fB\-\-default-product NUM\fP         " 10

+.IP "\fB\-C\fP \fB\-\-target-class NUM\fP         " 10 
 Target Device Class according to the USB specification. Some devices keep
 their original vendor/product ID after successful switching. To prevent
 them from being treated again, the device class can be checked.
 For unswitched devices it is always 8 (storage class), for switched
 modems it is often 0xff (vendor specific)
-.IP "\fB-m\fP \fB\-\-message-endpoint NUM\fP         " 10 
+.IP "\fB\-m\fP \fB\-\-message-endpoint NUM\fP         " 10 
 A specific endpoint to use for data transfers. Only for testing;
 the default is to determine endpoints from the device data

+.IP "\fB\-M\fP \fB\-\-message-content STRING\fP         " 10

 switching if the response is not read

+.IP "\fB\-d\fP \fB\-\-detach-only\fP         " 10 
 Detach the storage driver as the only action. This is sufficient for some
 devices to switch successfully
-.IP "\fB-H\fP \fB\-\-huawei-mode\fP         " 10 
+.IP "\fB\-H\fP \fB\-\-huawei-mode\fP         " 10

+.IP "\fB\-R\fP \fB\-\-reset-usb\fP         " 10 
 Send a USB reset command to the device. Can be combined with any switching
 method or stand alone. It is always done as the last step of all device
 interactions.
 Few devices need it to complete the switching; apart from that it may be
 useful during testing
-.IP "\fB-c\fP \fB\-\-config filename\fP         " 10 
+.IP "\fB\-c\fP \fB\-\-config filename\fP         " 10 
 Use a specific config file. If any ID or switching options are given as
 command line parameters, no config file (default or specific) is used.
 In that case all mandatory and optional parameters have to be provided on
 the command line
-.IP "\fB-Q\fP \fB\-\-quiet\fP         " 10 
+.IP "\fB\-Q\fP \fB\-\-quiet\fP         " 10

+.IP "\fB\-D\fP \fB\-\-sysmode\fP         " 10 
 Changes the behaviour of the program slightly. A success message including the
 effective target device ID is put out and a syslog notice is issued. Mainly for 
 integration with a wrapper script
-.IP "\fB-s\fP \fB\-\-success NUM\fP         " 10 
+.IP "\fB\-s\fP \fB\-\-success NUM\fP         " 10 
 After switching, keep checking for the result up to max. NUM seconds. If target IDs
 or target class were provided, their appearance indicates certain success. Otherwise
 the disconnection of the original device is rated as likely proof

+.IP "\fB\-I\fP \fB\-\-no-inquire\fP         " 10 
 do not obtain SCSI attributes from device (default is on). For proper identification
 of differing devices the attributes of the storage part provide valuable information.
 This is not needed for devices that are known and supported 
-.IP "\fB-i\fP \fB\-\-interface NUM\fP         " 10 
+.IP "\fB\-i\fP \fB\-\-interface NUM\fP         " 10

 for testing
