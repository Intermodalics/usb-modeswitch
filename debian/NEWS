usb-modeswitch (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  For the 1.0.0 release, the command line options have changed in two ways from
  their behavior in the 0.9.* versions:
   * On/off flags don't require arguments anymore (e.g. '-H' instead of '-H 1')
   * long option names changed to standard format (e.g. --huawei-mode instead
     of --HuaweiMode).

  The old options are _not_ recognised and _will_ make usb_modeswitch fail. So
  check your scripts and everything that might be using these command lines.
